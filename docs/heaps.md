# Heaps

A heap is a special _Tree based data structure_ in which the tree is a complete
binary tree. Generally, _Heaps_ can be of two types:

- **Max-heap**: In a max-heap, the key present at the root node must be the greatest
among the keys present at all of its children. The same property must hold true
for all the subtrees in that binary tree.
- **Min-heap**: In a min-heap, the key present at the root node must be the minimum
among the keys present at all of its children. The same property must hold true
for all the subtrees in that binary tree.
